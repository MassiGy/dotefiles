-- { THIS IS THE VIMRC FILE FOR THE VIM VRAPPER FOR ECLIPSE IDE }

-- also, to learn more about vrapper check out this discussion:
-- https://sourceforge.net/p/vrapper/discussion/901741/thread/a3347740/

-- also, from this, I got a list of vrapper supported commands 
-- link: https://vrapper.sourceforge.net/documentation/index.php?topic=commands

-- Besides, I added some of my nvim config to the builtin eclipse keybindings client
-- and for the most of them they do work out of the box, but for others I added a leader key
-- which is ",". Exemple: "gcc" in my nvim setup went to ",gcc" (toggle comment). This is due
-- to the fact that the builtin keybinding client does not provide a way to seperate insert mode
-- and normal mode for the vrapper plugin.


-- remap of the esc key ( this will remap the esc key to jk in insert mode  
vnoremap jk <Esc>
inoremap jk <Esc>


-- remap for the page scroll - keep the cursor at the center 
nnoremap <C-d> <C-d>zz
nnoremap <C-u> <C-u>zz

nnoremap { {zz
nnoremap } }zz

-- Keep the searched terms in the middel of the screen
nnoremap n nzzzv
nnoremap N Nzzzv

-- remap for when moving multiple line in visutal mode - this keeps the indentation right
vnoremap <A-j> :m >+1<CR>gv=gv
vnoremap <A-k> :m <-2<CR>gv=gv

-- change the behavior of J in normal mode since J makes the line below you go up
-- all to the end of your current line the problem is that your cursor goes to the end 
-- as well so with the new behavior we mark the current [p]oint and then we do the J 
-- then we go back to our marked [p]oint.
nnoremap J mpJ`p


-- remap the <C-c> to <ESC> in insert mode this is because <C-c> does have some 
-- weird behavior just look up theprimeagean neovim setup from scratch video.
inoremap <C-c> <Esc>


nnoremap <Space> <Nop>
vnoremap <Space> <Nop>
