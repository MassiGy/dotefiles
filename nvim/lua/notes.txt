Before, I was splitting my cmp and lsp configuration 
into two files which were cmp_config and lsp_config, 
the idea is to provide the cmp configuration and 
mappings table to the lsp_config file through the 
cmp_config file. These quick notes below explains 
what I've did. I've commited to remerge the config
file into one, since my cmp mappings wont work for 
me. First I thought it was a problem with me and lua
since I do not master the language yet, I thought that
my way of exporting the table was not correct. But as 
it turned out, even after mergin the two files, it 
did not work either, so I do want to let these notes 
here since they kind of explain what cmp and lsp(s) 
do.

file : cmp_config


-- NOTES: this file is only responsible for requiring 
-- cmp and luasnip so as we can customize the keybinding
-- that trigger the complition. This keybinding are given
-- in a form of a table and it will be exported/returned 
-- from the file to be used in outer files like lsp.lua.
-- Just to make it more clear, cmp is the engine that 
-- fetchs the complition if you will and luasnip is the 
-- plugin that draws it into the screen as windows. Thus
-- you can change the look and feel of the windows inside
-- the setup function of luasnip.


-- local cmp_select = {behavior = cmp.SelectBehavior.Select}


file : lsp_config

-- NOTES: lsp are language servers that run in the background to
-- provide complition that matches the current buffer and line.
-- To use lsp complition you need a complition engine, the one
-- that I am using is cmp. So cmp is a complition engine which
-- means that it is the one that takes the output of lsp i.e the
-- complitions and render them in small windows to the developer
-- or the one using the editor. Besides that, cmp can take other
-- sources as input, most famous ones are cmp-buffer, cmp-path
-- for buffer complition and file path based complitions.
--
-- In this file, I setup the lsp, I am using lsp zero for my nvim
-- config and the recommended preset. On top of that I added some
-- settings, most of which are keybinding to trigger complition (imported
-- them from cmp_config file) or trigger other lsp utilities like goto def...
-- We use these keybinding to customize our neovim experience and also
-- to make sure that the lsp servers run only when asked for performence
-- reasons.
--
-- Besides that, my cmp config is on the cmp_config file that basicaly
-- setup the keybindings that triggers complition. Since I am perfectly
-- happy with the cmp windowing system and how the complition arrives to
-- me that is the necessary configuration that I needed to add
--
-- After setting up my cmp config file, I export that mapping as a table
-- and import them in this file so as I can attach them to my lsp (as mentionned
-- above)
